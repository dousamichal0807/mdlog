/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// use mdlog::Logger;
/// use mdlog::LogLevel;
/// use mdlog::loggers::TextLogger;
///
/// use std::io::stdout;
///
/// fn main() {
///     let mut logger = TextLogger::new(LogLevel::Warning, stdout());
///     // These messages will not get printed, because their log level is too low:
///     logger.log(LogLevel::Debug, "This is a debug message");
///     logger.log(LogLevel::Info, "This is an informational message");
///     // These will get printed, because their log level is high enough:
///     logger.log(LogLevel::Warning, "Something suspicious happened");
///     logger.log(LogLevel::Error, "Oh, no! An error occurred!");
///     logger.log(LogLevel::Fatal, "NO! FATAL ERROR! Application is shut down!");
/// }
/// ```

/// [`File`]: std::fs::File
/// [`Stdout`]: std::io::Stdout
/// [`TcpStream`]: std::net::TcpStream
